    <td>Today's lesson was the final one of the topic and the term. As it was the last lesson, Oscar and I were desperate to move on to the robot arm; and because we got so far in the previous lesson, we were only two similar exercises away. These stages involved an LED and a LDR in collaboration. The first one was turning the light on when the LDR received low light, and the second one was a basic burglar alarm. With ten minutes to spare, we moved on to the robot arm, which was really exciting. For the arm it was all coding, so Oscar and I took it in turns writing out the code. Time was running short so we quickly got some movement on our iPads in the nick of time.</td>

    <td>Today was not as good as last week as Oscar and I were a little slower. This may have been because we were moving in to the trickier things or because the lesson started quite late, but in the end we achieved our goal, which was to move on to the robot arm. Various small problems held us back quite a bit, but they were mostly on the coding end, which was Oscar. Whilst Oscar fixed the code, I went around again helping others wire up their breadboards correctly which was a good use of my time.</td>

    <td>Overall this term I am pleased with mine and Oscarâ€™s progress coding with FUZE boxes. We have had some ups and downs, but in general, we worked pretty well as a team. There were many obstacles and changes to what was happening - with Rex - in our group, but I personally think that I have coped well overall with the change and new challenges in this topic. I think that I have learnt a lot with FUZE boxes and I am looking forward to next term which I believe is Python coding.</td>
