    <td>Today's lesson was our first lesson back from half term. This meant that most of us were rusty in our coding skills but I think that I was fine as I had done some coding over the half term and so I still had the functions and commands in my head. The lesson went on pretty well and I progressed well. Like last time I also assisted other people in their coding. Because I am progressing on the coding was getting harder and when I was really stuck and had no idea what to do I got the solution. Fortunately this only happened about two times and so the lesson was quite productive.</td>

    <td>This lesson the only thing that limited my learning was some of the exercises because I got really stuck in some of them and so I had to use the solution. Otherwise I feel that Ii did pretty well this lesson and hope to continue on this effort next lesson.</td>
