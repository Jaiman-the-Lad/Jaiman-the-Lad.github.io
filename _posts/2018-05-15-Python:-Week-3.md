    <td>Today was another solid lesson on Codecademy Python. I had completed Pyg Latin at home and started on the functions topic which brought more complex elements and ideas to the table. The first exercise consisted of 19 parts and i worked through them steadily and only using the solution button once when I was really stuck. Then I moved onto the next exercise and got half way through before it was the end of the lesson. Today was very productive and increased my understanding and skills in Python.</td>
