    <td>Today was another decent week of Codecademy Python. Due to doing quite a bit of homework, I started ahead of most people on exercise 3. At this stage things began to get a bit more difficult and confusing using different forms of controls. On the final task I overcomplicated the task and Rex had caught up to me in that time where I was pondering on how I could complete the code. It turns out that there was a much simpler way of doing it and I was a bit annoyed with myself for making my life difficult. Now I have completed the controls I am onto Pyg Latin now at home.</td>

    <td>Today my main drawback was that final exercise where I wasted a lot of time on something which really held me back. In hindsight the solution was incredibly simple and I would have got to it on my own if a hadn't of looked at the code as if it was incredibly complicated.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will prevent myself from over complicating the work by looking at the code first and seeing how it works and then actually inputting code in. I need to think that Codecademy isnâ€™t trying to kill me in confusing code and that it is there to make my life simpler when coding.</td>
