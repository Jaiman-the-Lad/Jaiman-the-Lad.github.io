    <td>This lesson was another good lesson progressing on Codecademy python. Most of the exercises I did today were recapping on previous exercises and so it took quite a while as I had to remember code from over a month ago. This held me back a bit but I managed to get through it pretty well.</td>

    <td>This week I almost achieved my target, but I had to use the solution button once when I had no clue what was going on. Next time I will try to refrain from the temptation of the solution.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>If I get stuck next time I should probably ask someone else before going to the solution button as this will help me more  and it will also help others remember what they have learnt.</td>
