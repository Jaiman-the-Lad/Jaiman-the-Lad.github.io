    <td>Today was the first IT lesson back from the holidays and we swapped around our classrooms and teachers. For me, it was IT with Mr Keen which I was very happy with and our topic is now python (the coding language). I had some background knowledge on the subject as I had done some Codecademy on python a couple of years ago. Mr Keen introduced us to the topic and what we are going to be doing over this term to start the lesson and then he sent us off to do some coding. Throughout the lesson we had a couple of chats about python and the syntax of it which helped us progress. We also have a progress tracker which we have to fill in at the beginning and end of the lesson. This lesson I think I did really well and got quite far through the first exercise compared to others.</td>

    <td>I didn't really encounter many difficulties this lesson but the exercise I left off on confused me quite a bit and so I’ll try and tackle/get past it for homework. Unlike last term we have non-blog homework and so that will give me something to do at home as well.</td>

    <td>Next time I will aim to keep up the standards from this lesson because I feel that I did really well today - I even helped out some other people around me which felt good.</td>
