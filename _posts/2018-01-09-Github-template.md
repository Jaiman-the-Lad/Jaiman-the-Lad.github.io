    <td>Today we did our first proper lesson with the FUZE box. As I had learnt some python a couple of years ago, this coding language wasn't too confusing. I was partnered up with Oscar R and I felt that we worked pretty well together - we progressed further than most of the other groups. I was impressed with the last bit we got on to, the "apples" variables part. I think that I was a better navigator than pilot and for Oscar it was the other way round so that was another factor why we worked well together.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that we were a little slow to start off with, because our FUZE box wasn’t functioning properly, this hindered our progress slightly. Another thing that we didn’t do so well was saving our work. We did save our work regularly, but when we tried and opened a saved file, the editor was completely blank and there was nothing on the page that you run your program on. Saving our work is something which we need to work on for next time.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time Oscar and I need to work on saving our work properly by maybe asking for help from Mr Ampah-Korsah if we haven’t worked it out by then. We also need to speed up setting up our FUZE box because we weren’t too quick doing that either. But when we got up and running I think that Oscar and I progressed well and so we need to keep up that good flow.</td>
