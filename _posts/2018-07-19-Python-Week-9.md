    <td>This lesson was another good lesson in Python Codecademy, there were visitors coming in so I had to make sure my coding was good. Nevertheless my extra homework did pay off as I was on point with my coding. This lesson there were some struggles, but rather than using the solution button I asked other people and they helped me.</td>
